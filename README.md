Specs for Beep Boop



Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

The number 13 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop".
The number 32 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.

Example: If a user inputs a 5, the program should display a list of values: "0", "Beep!", "Boop", "I'm Sorry...", 4, 5

Specs

Break the program down into simple, individual behaviors with input/output examples. Begin with the simplest possible behavior. List these behaviors (also known as "specs" or "specifications") in the project's README.md file. To get you started, this should be one of your first specs:


Spec: The program returns an error for all nonNumber Inputs
Input:"Hello"
Output "error"

Spec: The program converts the inputted string into an interger
Input: "1"
Output 1

Spec: The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number
Input: "4"
Output: "0, 1, 2, 3, 4"

Spec: The program converts the intergers back into Strings
0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
"0", "1", "2", "3" "4"


Spec: The program recoginizes the number 1 and returns Beep
Input: "1"
Output: "Beep"
Input: "17"
Output: "Beep"
Input "2"
Output: "Boop"



Include similar specifications in your README for all behaviors your program demonstrates.
